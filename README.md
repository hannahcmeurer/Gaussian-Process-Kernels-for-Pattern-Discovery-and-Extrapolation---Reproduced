# Gaussian-Process-Kernels-for-Pattern-Discovery-and-Extrapolation-Reproduced

This repository is meant for the reproduction of Andrew Gordson paper Gaussian Process Kernels for Pattern Discovery and Extrapolation specifically of the figure on Mauna Loa CO2 Concentrations. The data for the CO2 concentration can be taken from [link for data](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html). Andrew Gordson uses the data from from 1968-2010, the first 200 months for training and 301 months for testing.

G0rdspn compares his SM kernel with other popluar kernels such as Matern, Squared Exponential, Rational quadratic, and periodic kernels.
