# Gaussian-Process-Kernels-for-Pattern-Discovery-and-Extrapolation-Reproduced

This repository is meant for the reproduction of Andrew Gordson paper Gaussian Process Kernels for Pattern Discovery and Extrapolation specifically of the figure on Mauna Loa CO2 Concentrations. The data for the CO2 concentration can be taken from [link for data](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html). Andrew Gordson uses the data from from 1968-2010, the first 200 months for training and 301 months for testing. Here is the link for the [project proposal](https://github.com/hannahcmeurer/Gaussian-Process-Kernels-for-Pattern-Discovery-and-Extrapolation-Reproduced/blob/master/EECS599_Project1_week1_Hannah_Caldwell_Meurer.pdf) for this project. 

Gordson compares his SM kernel with other popluar kernels such as Matern, Squared Exponential, Rational quadratic, and periodic kernels. Through testing I was not able to replicate his RBF in this figure below, but I also found another image from his tutorial page for matlab and the RBF line is different.

For this project these must be installed for using with python 3.7.  [Requirements here](https://github.com/hannahcmeurer/Gaussian-Process-Kernels-for-Pattern-Discovery-and-Extrapolation-Reproduced/blob/master/Requirements.txt)



This project is done for CS599 at NAU during the fall 2019 semester
